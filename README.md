# jblyr - A quick job board with React, Meteor and Material UI
I recently wrote a mini-tutorial “How to write a job app in 48 lines of code” — and here it is again, but using React JS: Facebook’s javascript love-child. This is slightly longer than 48 lines of code, but mainly because I also integrated a Material UI interface. I actually learned React so I could use this UI library. React is not strictly necessary with the Meteor framework, as Meteor is reactive out-of-the-box — but I like Google’s Material UI style, and it required React, so here we are.
